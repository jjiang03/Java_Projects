Calculate Math Library

The Calculate Math Library project is a program that contains many mathematical functions and calculations like multiplication, addition, finding the average of values, square roots, and more. The code contains a mixture of for loops, if statements, integer parsing, and more. 

Encryption

The Encryption project gives users the option to encrypt or decrypt words with single or ten digit cyphers, also known as a Caesar Cypher. The code contains combinations of for-loops, if statements, and more in order to encrypt or decrypt messages selected by the user.

Login Data Project (both)

The Login Data Project is a program that collects the user’s email address, time spent logged in each session, and then compares it to other user times, printing the user’s name who has the most time logged in. The code focuses on using ArrayLists to store and compare data and implementing complex for loops and if statements. 

Text Excel

The TextExcel project is a program that can hold and modify data, similar to Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. The code works to create a sheet with individual cells in which the user can input data into. The program is an object-oriented program that contains many different parts of code coming together. It contains coding techniques like inheritance, for loops, if statements, and other object-oriented programming methods

AverageGrade

The Average Grade project collects grades from 0 to 100 and finds the average grade between all the grades. It also returns the total, lowest, and highest score for the user to see. This program contains a network of if-statements that work together to generate the output.

Coin Change

The Coin Change program calculates the change the user will receive in coins after buying an item that costs between 0 to 1 dollar. It will return the change with the least amount of coins. This program contains conditional if-else statements that help return the different coins needed to equate to the change.
